Hello! I'm Shaz and I'm the human behind Sizzling Like a Sausage. As I'm writing this section, I have little Sizzle sleeping at my feet and he's the reason for this blog! Here, you'll find useful or random details of my adventures with Sizzle. I read somewhere that we get the dog that we need, not the dog that we want and I truly think that it may be true - even if sometimes it doesn't feel like it. 

Sizzle is full of personality and has taught me more than I could've ever expected and I know for a fact that I still have so much more to learn. 

Brace yourselves for some drama, funny stories, rants but more importantly: proud moments!
