Hi there! I’m Shaz and I’m the human of a Wirehaired Dachshund called Sizzle. I wanted to start this blog because Sizzle is now over 2 years old and still loves keeping me on my toes! 

Being a dog owner definitely comes with its challenges and I suppose not many talk about it, or at least not to the extent that I intend on talking about it. Before you think that I have all the answers: I do not, not even close. But what I do have, is 2 years of dog-‘motherhood’ experience which realistically, isn’t a lot. I’ve been (and I’m still going) through the rollercoaster of separation anxiety, reactivity, crate training, finding the right foods and treats and everything else that comes with being Sizzle’s mum! 

I’ve had many successes and double the failures. I’m learning as we go along and it’s been quite a journey so far. This is my space to share our achievements and our challenges, to be completely transparent about how draining but also how rewarding it can be to have a dog.

If you’re anxious, overwhelmed or feeling guilty - welcome to the club! Maybe my posts will make you feel better and you’ll be able to relate to the point where you’ll be able to share your own journey and if you do, I’m all ears!

See you in the next post!
