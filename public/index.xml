      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there! I’m Shaz and I’m the human of a Wirehaired Dachshund called Sizzle. I wanted to start this blog because Sizzle is now over 2 years old and still loves keeping me on my toes!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being a dog owner definitely comes with its challenges and not many talk about it. Before you think that I have all the answers: I do not, not even close. What I have is 2 years of dog-‘motherhood’ experience which realistically, isn’t a lot but we make do. I’ve been (and I’m still going) through the rollercoaster of separation anxiety, reactivity, crate training, finding the right foods and treats and everything else that comes with being Sizzle’s mum!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
