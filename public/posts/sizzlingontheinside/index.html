Hello Sizzlers,
Being a dog parent (or guardian or whatever else you prefer to call it), has definitely added to something that has always been present in my life: imposter syndrome.
To this day, I often find myself wondering: ‚ÄúAm I even cut out to look after this little puppy?‚Äù, the self-doubt crept in pretty fast since day 1 and I still battle with it. A good example: I&rsquo;d go &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t he settle down?‚Äù to &ldquo;Hold on, why is he so quiet during the day? Is he sad? Am I not doing enough?&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg.">

<p>Hello Sizzlers,</p>
<p>Being a dog parent (or guardian or whatever else you prefer to call it), has definitely added to something that has always been present in my life: <strong>imposter syndrome</strong>.</p>
<p>To this day, I often find myself wondering: ‚ÄúAm I even cut out to look after this little puppy?‚Äù, the self-doubt crept in pretty fast since day 1 and I still battle with it. A good example: I&rsquo;d go &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t he settle down?‚Äù to &ldquo;Hold on, why is he so quiet during the day? Is he sad? Am I not doing enough?&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>The truth is, I should have been celebrating rather than doubting myself. Celebrating things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How he‚Äôs able to settle throughout the day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How our communication has become clearer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How we‚Äôve built a solid routine and get to spend so much time together</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you get a dog, you want and hope for the dog that will be super friendly, confident and that will want to listen to you. You may read books, download a few apps and you let yourself get sucked into the abundance of conflicting information out there.</p>
<p>Some of it works. Some doesn‚Äôt. Maybe the method isn‚Äôt the right fit. Maybe the timing is off. Either way, it‚Äôs overwhelming and before you know it, you‚Äôre questioning yourself. So you research more. And then more. And then&hellip; burnout.</p>
<p>Seriously, I felt burnt out <em>all the time</em>.</p>
<p>And let‚Äôs be honest: social media doesn‚Äôt help. It makes it easy to want perfection and easy to make you feel down when you can&rsquo;t live up to those standards.</p>
<p>All your focus goes toward your dog, and you forget to take care of yourself. Some days or weeks go by like this.</p>
<p>For a while, I really struggled to cope with my daily life while also trying to meet Sizzle‚Äôs needs. But what I‚Äôve learned is this: <strong>It‚Äôs okay not to have it all figured out. It‚Äôs okay to ask for help</strong>.</p>
<p>I have worked with my fair share of trainers, some I didn‚Äôt agree with or like, some weren‚Äôt the right fit, some couldn‚Äôt offer the support I needed. But I didn‚Äôt give up. I knew I couldn‚Äôt do it all alone and found the right trainers. Now, I genuinely feel like I‚Äôm in the right place.</p>
<p>I feel so lucky to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trainers who really listen and guide me.</li>
<li>Fellow dog friends I can vent to.</li>
<li>A tighter, more manageable set of resources I can turn to without getting overwhelmed.</li>
</ul>
<p>And asking for help doesn‚Äôt have to stop at training. Sizzle has separation anxiety (although, part of me thinks it‚Äôs more FOMO than anything). It can be draining, frustrating, and isolating. I honestly thought &ldquo;I guess I can never leave the house alone again.‚Äù but that‚Äôs not realistic or fair to either of us.</p>
<p>Now, I have a solid (though occasionally shaky!) support system: sitters, friends, and family I can rely on when I need to go to the office or have a night out. It‚Äôs not easy and it takes A LOT of planning but it works. It gives me the chance to have dog-free time, even if just for a few hours.</p>
<p>And all of that? It‚Äôs worth celebrating too.
We‚Äôve overcome a lot already and I know we‚Äôll overcome even more. So I‚Äôm celebrating things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sizzle not howling for 3 minutes when I leave, when just last week he howled the moment I touched the door handle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sizzle playing with toys outdoors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sizzle not barking when a child or another dog gets a bit too close and listening to me instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So here‚Äôs your reminder:
Forget what everyone else is doing. Focus on your own wins. Celebrate what you and your dog have achieved.</p>
<p>It feels a lot better than spiraling into self-doubt. And if you make a mistake, that‚Äôs okay. Regroup. Learn. Try again. You‚Äôre human. Mistakes will happen but you‚Äôve got this.</p>
<p>See you in the next post!</p>
