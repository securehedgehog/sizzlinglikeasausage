Being a dog owner definitely comes with its challenges and not many talk about it. Before you think that I have all the answers: I do not, not even close. What I have is 2 years of dog-‚Äòmotherhood‚Äô experience which realistically, isn‚Äôt a lot but we make do.

      <p>Hi there! I‚Äôm Shaz and I‚Äôm the human of a Wirehaired Dachshund called Sizzle. I wanted to start this blog because Sizzle is now over 2 years old and still loves keeping me on my toes!</p>
<p>Being a dog owner definitely comes with its challenges and not many talk about it. Before you think that I have all the answers: I do not, not even close. What I have is 2 years of dog-‚Äòmotherhood‚Äô experience which realistically, isn‚Äôt a lot but we make do. I‚Äôve been (and I‚Äôm still going) through the rollercoaster of separation anxiety, reactivity, crate training, finding the right foods and treats and everything else that comes with being Sizzle‚Äôs mum!</p>
<p>I‚Äôve had many successes and double the failures. I‚Äôm learning as we go along and it‚Äôs been quite a journey so far. This is my space to share our achievements and our challenges, to be completely transparent about how draining but also how rewarding it can be to have a dog.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre anxious, overwhelmed or feeling guilty - welcome to the club! Maybe my posts will make you feel better or not, but maybe you‚Äôll be able to relate. My comments section will stay open and if you want to share your own journey and perspectives, I‚Äôm all ears!</p>
<p>See you in the next post!</p>
