      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;markdown-image&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:62327/images/sizzle01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sizzle as a puppy&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hello Sizzlers,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here comes our first real post!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t too sure what I wanted to focus on, ChatGPT suggested “A time Sizzle ate my slippers” and that didn’t really feel very inspired.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I got Sizzle, my life turned upside down. Everyone made dog ownership look so easy but for me, it wasn’t. I cried almost daily for six months. This post isn’t going to be a cute cheesy dog story, it’s the truth about what it really took me to bond with a puppy, and how I learned to become the human he needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there! I’m Shaz and I’m the human of a Wirehaired Dachshund called Sizzle. I wanted to start this blog because Sizzle is now over 2 years old and still loves keeping me on my toes!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being a dog owner definitely comes with its challenges and not many talk about it. Before you think that I have all the answers: I do not, not even close. What I have is 2 years of dog-‘motherhood’ experience which realistically, isn’t a lot but we make do. I’ve been (and I’m still going) through the rollercoaster of separation anxiety, reactivity, crate training, finding the right foods and treats and everything else that comes with being Sizzle’s mum!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
